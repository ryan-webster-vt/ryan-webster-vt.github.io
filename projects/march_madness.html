        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p> The NCAA College Basketball Tournament, better known as March Madness, is a 68-team, single elimination tournament held every spring to determine the national champion.
        The selection process for the tournament is complex, with 31 teams receiving automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments, and 37 teams receiving at-large bids based on their performance during the regular season and conference tournaments.
        This project aims to predict which teams will receive at-large bids using machine learning techniques, leveraging historical data and team metrics from the 2019 to 2025 seasons. Also, this project will provide insights into the factors 
        that influence at-large selections, by looking at metrics like SOR (Strength of Record), NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool), number of Quad 1 wins and Quad 3 and 4 losses, and KenPom ratings.
        </p>
        <p>
        The model achieved 96% accuracy in predicting which teams would receive at-large bids, especially in the 2025 season, where the model predicted 36 of the 37 at-large teams, outperforming 
        expert analyst such as ESPN's Joe Lunardi and CBS Sports' Jerry Palm.
