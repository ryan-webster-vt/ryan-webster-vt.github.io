        <section class="Overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Gauging how "clutch" (their ability to win in close game situations) can be tricky. For instance, saying
                a team is clutch because they win a lot of close one possesion games can be misleading. This is because
                final scores can lack context of
                the entire game. For example, a team may be up three possesions with two minutes left and the opposing
                team scores two touchdowns in garbage time. Does this make the winning team clutch? No. It goes both
                ways too. In an attempt to measure a team's "clutchness",
                I created a custom metric that takes into account the win probability of a team with two minutes left in
                the game and then calculated the expected win total for the 2024-2025 regular season and compared it to
                their actual win total. If it's positive,
                that means that team won more than expected in close game situations, and if it's negative, they lost
                more than expected.</p>

            <h3>Clutchness Factor Metric</h3>
            <p>In this project, I define a team's Clutchness Factor (CF) for a specific game as the result of the game
                (1 for win, 0 for loss) minus their win probability with two minutes left to go. So, a team with a 99%
                win probabilty with two minutes left that won would
                only recieve a CF of 0.01, while a team with a 20% win probability that won would receive a CF of 0.8
                and the opposing team who lost would recieve a CF of -0.8. This metric is then summed across all games
                for each team to get their overall Clutchness Factor for the season. Note that the CF for a given team
                for the entire
                season is simply their actual win total minus expected win total with two minutes remaining.</p>

            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>After computing the expected win totals, I found that Iowa St. was the most clutch team with a win
                expectancy of 8.353 compared to a win total of 10.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Cyclones received <strong>0.87 points</strong> in their 20–19 win over Iowa, coming back from a
                    19–7 deficit and winning on a last-second 54-yard field goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iowa State received <strong>0.97 points</strong> in their 38–35 win over UCF. They came back from
                    only a <strong>3%</strong> chance to win after UCF was driving in ISU territory up 5 with 2 minutes
                    left, forcing a punt. ISU then drove 11 plays, 80 yards, in 1:18 to take the lead and win.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iowa State lost <strong>0.839 points</strong> in their 23–22 loss to Texas Tech after blowing an
                    <strong>83.9%</strong> win probability. The Red Raiders drove 71 yards in 1:47 to score and win.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iowa State received <strong>0.63 points</strong> in their 31–28 win over Utah. They scored a
                    touchdown to take the lead, and Utah missed a 54-yard field goal that would have tied the game.
                </li>
